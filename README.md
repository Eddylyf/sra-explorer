# sra-explorer

Web application to explore the Sequence Read Archive. Mostly just a toy to
play around with AngularJS at this point, but has potential to turn into
something useful in the future.

See it in action here: http://ewels.github.io/sra-explorer/

All the useful bits are taken from [Labrador](https://github.com/ewels/labrador).
